The file BasicFunctions.mws contains tools that will be used in each successive computation.

Many identical copies of input.mws are created by the shell script cpBig.sh.
The script sedBig.sh changes the copy of input.mws to a new value for the place in the loop, which corresponds to a different isotopic component to be computed.
The file input.mws is called via the shell script execute_maple.sh and sends the file to a different instance of maple for each place in the loop. 

The output files can be quite large (up to 32MB in the largest degree 8 cases), so we omit them here. However, we do report the fillings of the tableaux for each module in the isotypic decomposition.

The filling files give the shape of the module together with a list of fillings that produce linearly independent Young symmetrizers.

The "for_m2" files give the list of modules that occurred in the ideal of the quadrifocal variety up to the S_4 symmetry.  

The files F5_out, F6_out, etc. contain the full list of modules in each degree, not reduced by the S_4 symmetry. 

For degree 9, the isotopic components that were not fully computed are indexed by the following:
1157, 1159, 1160, 1162, 1163, 1164, 1165, 1166, 1167, 1168, 1169, 1170, 1171, 1172, 1173, 1174, 1175, 1176, 1177, 1178, 1179, 1180, 1181, 1182, 1183, 1184, 1185, 1186, 1187, 1188, 1189, 1190, 1191, 1192, 1193, 1194, 1195, 1196, 1197, 1198, 1199, 1200, 1201, 1202, 1203, 1204, 1205

quad_conversion.mws unsymmetrizes the resulting modules and converts the list of modules to a macaulay2 readable format.

Quadrifocal_to_deg_9_SchurRings.m2 performs the SchurRings computations in Macaulay2. It reads the file quad_Schur_data.m2.
